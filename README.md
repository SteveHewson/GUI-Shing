# GUI-Shing
GUI-Shing is a terminal-gui version of [Shing](https://github.com/SteveHewson/Shing)<br>
Yes, they both have the same name in the script and do exactly the same, except that the GUI-Shing had to be labelled differently to be able to have a seperate repository to keep future contributions (if any) as individual as possible.<br>
Here are some screenshots from GUI-Shing:<br>
